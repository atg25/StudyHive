# **Executive Summary**Provide summary information about the project and why it is needed:

Our group will create an e-commerce website to sell a dynamic, collaborative, and easily accessible learning ecosystem by combining the strengths of platforms we are all familiar with like Notion, Chegg, Quizlet, Reddit, and AI into one integrated experience. This platform aims to make it easier for students to study and share knowledge by transforming messy class notes into more structured learning resources to look back upon. Our platform will have AI summaries, personalized study packets, interactive flashcards, and Khan Academy–style video explanations all of which will be communal for users to share and learn from. We envision a future where every student, no matter the grade level, will use our platform as their primary learning resource to get a head in class. Ultimately, our vision is to break down barriers to learning, help students with collaboration, and empower individuals to study in a stress free way.

# **Project Purpose** With greater specificity, state the purpose of the project.

Our project purpose is to design and sell a platform where students can upload, share, and access class notes, which our AI will transform into diverse study formats. At the basic level (free version), users can browse notes and AI generated summaries to better understand concepts. The plus tier will provide better features with customized study packets, the latest AI models, and unlimited access to expert verified material, ensuring more effective education. The premium tier provides the best support with AI personalized tutoring and video walkthroughs, making it worth the cost of the subscription. We will merge collaborative knowledge sharing with AI, making it our mission to create a scalable, learning hub that becomes the next big e-commerce hit.

## **Business Objectives**

A project should support the objectives in the strategic plan. List specific strategic plan objectives and describe how the project supports each one.

**Enhance Access to Quality Education**

* Provide affordable, accessible, and high-quality study resources (demonstrated via prototype).  
* Use AI to automatically convert unstructured notes into organized, user-friendly formats.  
* Demonstrate how collaborative sharing can improve academic success for students.

**Create a Unified Learning Platform**

* Showcase a single, interactive web application made by students for students.  
* Integrate familiar features from educational and social platforms to encourage engagement.  
* Demonstrate scalability through design and showing how the system could grow beyond the classroom if developed further.

# **Project Details**

Describe the project of choice in greater detail.

Our project is all based on our product goal, which is to design a functional prototype website where students can upload, share, and access class notes, which an integrated AI model will convert into multiple study formats.

The free version allows users to browse notes and AI-generated summaries. The plus tier (simulated) demonstrates enhanced features like custom study packets and verified resources. The premium tier (simulated) shows advanced concepts such as AI tutoring and video walkthroughs. Though these tiers will not involve actual transactions, they showcase how a future system could be structured if scaled for public use.

## **Requirements**

**Our Product:**

Functional front-end interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP).

Database integration using MySQL for user and note data.

Basic AI integration or simulation for summaries (using APIs or placeholder functions).

Secure user authentication (login/register system).

Demonstration of data retrieval and sharing (e.g., view or download notes).

Proper documentation and presentation of the system.

**Project:**

Fully Developed Website for sales.

Payment System Up and Running.

Database to store the products you sell, customer info, etc..

Shopping cart to add the products for purchase.

Search feature to find the products on the site.

## **Deliverables**

List the project deliverables. A deliverable is a unique and verifiable product, result or capability to perform a service that must be produced to complete a process, phase or project.

* Presence Map for our project and all ideas mapped out.  
* User registration and authentication system (students and verified experts).  
* AI integration for automated summarization and content transformation.  
* Database to manage users, uploaded content, and subscription tiers.  
* E-commerce features for handling payments and tier upgrades.

* Web and mobile responsive interface.  
* Admin dashboard for content moderation and analytics.  
* Secure cloud hosting and encrypted data handling.


We aim to deliver these features to customers in a tiered subscription format, with two main tiers. We will also have institution based deals for these groups to get school-wide user subscriptions for all individuals in the institution.
